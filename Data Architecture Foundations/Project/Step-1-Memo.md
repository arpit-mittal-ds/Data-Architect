Hi,

Welcome to Tech ABC Corp. We are excited to have some new talent onboard. As you may already know, Tech ABC Corp has recently experienced a lot of growth. Our AI powered video game console WOPR has been hugely successful and as a result, our company has grown from 10 employees to 200 in only 6 months (and we are projecting a 20% growth a year for the next 5 years). We have also grown from our Dallas, Texas office, to 4 other locations nationwide: New York City, NY, San Francisco, CA, Minneapolis, MN, and Nashville, TN.

While this growth is great, it is really starting to put a strain on our record keeping in HR. We currently maintain all employee information on a shared spreadsheet. When HR consisted of only myself, managing everyone on an Excel spreadsheet was simple, but now that it is a shared document I am having serious reservations about data integrity and data security. If the wrong person got their hands on the HR file, they would see the salaries of every employee in the company, all the way up to the president.

After speaking with Jacob Lauber, the manager of IT, he suggested I put in a request to have my HR Excel file converted into a database. He suggested I reach out to you as I am told you have experience in designing and building databases. When you are building this, please keep in mind that I want any employee with a domain login to be have read only access the database. I just don't want them having access to salary information. That needs to be restricted to HR and management level employees only. Management and HR employees should also be the only ones with write access. By our current estimates, 90% of users will be read only.

I also want to make sure you know that am looking to turn my spreadsheet into a live database, one I can input and edit information into. I am not really concerned with reporting capabilities at the moment. Since we are working with employee data we are required by federal regulations to maintain this data for at least 7 years; additionally, since this is considered business critical data, we need to make sure it gets backed up properly.

As a final consideration. We would like to be able to connect with the payroll department's system in the future. They maintain employee attendance and paid time off information. It would be nice if the two systems could interface in the future

I am looking forward to working with you and seeing what kind of database you design for us.

Thanks,
Sarah Collins
Head of HR

Let's get started
As mentioned in the memo above, you are going to design and build an HR database for Tech ABC Corp. However, before you can start building, you need to complete both a business and technical proposal form answering some important questions about the database you are going to build.

Refer to your project starter Step 1. There, you will find the questions you need to answer, as well as additional documentation from Tech ABC Corp's IT department concerning best practices for database design, data governance, and other concerns.

While creating documentation is never high up on most people's list of fun things to do, it is still very important, as oftentimes business user expectations may not line up with technical realities. Having a proposal document to fall back on can save you a lot of head aches.

Hints
Make sure to keep the Business Requirement answers in plain English. Try to limit technical jargon, as this can often be off-putting to business partners. Remember, as a data architect, you will often have to work in two worlds (the business world, and the technical world) simultaneously.
