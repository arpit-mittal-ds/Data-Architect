# Notes

Instruction
In this step, I created a physical database using database model.

## Created the database using DDL SQL commands

An example query creating a team table within a dbtest database

## Loaded the data into your database, utilizing flat file ETL

## Answered a series of questions using CRUD SQL commands to demonstrate that my database was created and populated correctly

An example query checking out all of the example team data. The query is a basic SELECT * from team, with four teams as examples.

Note: the images are examples. The image you submit will be different based on the SQL server you choose.

Submission
For this step, you will need to submit SQL files containing all DDL SQL scripts used to create the database.

You will also have to submit screenshots showing CRUD commands, along with results for each of the questions found in the starter template.

Hints
Your DDL script will be graded by running the code you submit. Please ensure your SQL code runs properly!

Foreign keys cannot be created on tables that do not exist yet, so it may be easier to create all tables in the database, then to go back and run modify statements on the tables to create foreign key constraints.

After running CRUD commands like update, insert, or delete, run a select * command on the affected table, so the reviewer can see the results of the command.
