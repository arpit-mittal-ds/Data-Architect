# Data Governance at SneakerPark

Implemented Data Governance solutions for an online shoe reseller SneakerPark to better manage their data now and in the future. 

Created an Enterprise Data Model that provides a holistic view of all the data in their systems. 

Documented the metadata in an Enterprise Data Catalog and profile the data in their systems to identify data quality issues, suggested remediation strategies for each of those issues, and designed a data quality dashboard. 

Finally, sketched out a proposed MDM implementation architecture, defined a set of matching rules for the creation of customer and item master data, and defined the data governance roles and responsibilities that are necessary to oversee this data governance initiative.
