## PROJECT: Data Governance at SneakerPark


In this project, I implemented Data Governance solutions for an online shoe reseller SneakerPark to better manage their data now and in the future. 

First, I created an Enterprise Data Model that provides a holistic view of all the data in their systems. 

Next I documented the metadata in an Enterprise Data Catalog and profiled the data in their systems to identify data quality issues, suggested remediation strategies for each of these issues, and designed a data quality dashboard. 

Finally, I sketched out a proposed MDM implementation architecture, defined a set of matching rules for the creation of customer and item master data, and defined the data governance roles and responsibilities that are necessary to oversee this data governance initiative.


Summary
In this lesson, we learnt what Data Governance is and why it is important. We also learned the different stakeholders involved in Data Governance projects and a brief history of Data Governance. Finally, we reviewed the Data Governance project that you will work on as part of this course.

This course opens the door for us to work in many areas of Data Management. It will be beneficial if we are working as an Enterprise Data Architect.
