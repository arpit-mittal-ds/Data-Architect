## PROJECT: Data Governance at SneakerPark


In this project, I implemented Data Governance solutions for an online shoe reseller SneakerPark to better manage their data now and in the future. 

First, I created an Enterprise Data Model that provides a holistic view of all the data in their systems. 

Next I documented the metadata in an Enterprise Data Catalog and profiled the data in their systems to identify data quality issues, suggested remediation strategies for each of these issues, and designed a data quality dashboard. 

Finally, I sketched out a proposed MDM implementation architecture, defined a set of matching rules for the creation of customer and item master data, and defined the data governance roles and responsibilities that are necessary to oversee this data governance initiative.
