## What is Metadata Management

**Metadata** provides information about data, such as definitions, rules, format, data types. 

**Metadata Management is about capturing metadata scattered across the enterprise in a central repository that can be easily accessed by anyone in the enterprise.**
Business teams in different departments use the metadata management system in their day to day activities to find data, conduct processes, and create reports.

### Some important concepts in Metadata Management:

**Enterprise Data Model** provides a holistic view of the data in a company. It contains information about the structure of data, like entities, attributes, and relationships. Typically you have conceptual and logical Enterprise Data Models. 
Since the data is physically contained in many systems, there is no Enterprise Physical Data Model.

**Enterprise Data Catalog** is a consolidation of all the metadata in an enterprise. It contains information about the content of data like business glossaries, business rules, data dictionaries, data policies, data lineage...etc. Enterprise Data Catalog resides in a metadata repository which is a part of the Metadata Management System.

**Enterprise Data Model** is the foundation for creating an Enterprise Data Catalog. You first create an Enterprise Data Model. Then you add various metadata to the entities and attributes in an Enterprise Data Model to build an Enterprise Data Catalog.

### Different ways that people use a Metadata Management System:

Different people collaborate with each other to author different pieces of metadata for a data domain

People curate the content by categorizing and classifying data using tags and taxonomies so that information can be found quickly in the Metadata Management System

Users review the different metadata in a Metadata Management System and rate the content and quality
