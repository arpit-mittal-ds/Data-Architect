## What is Metadata Management

**Metadata** provides information about data, such as definitions, rules, format, data types. 

**Metadata Management is about capturing metadata scattered across the enterprise in a central repository that can be easily accessed by anyone in the enterprise.**
Business teams in different departments use the metadata management system in their day to day activities to find data, conduct processes, and create reports.

### Some important concepts in Metadata Management:

**Enterprise Data Model** provides a holistic view of the data in a company. It contains information about the structure of data, like entities, attributes, and relationships. Typically you have conceptual and logical Enterprise Data Models. 
Since the data is physically contained in many systems, there is no Enterprise Physical Data Model.

**Enterprise Data Catalog** is a consolidation of all the metadata in an enterprise. It contains information about the content of data like business glossaries, business rules, data dictionaries, data policies, data lineage...etc. Enterprise Data Catalog resides in a metadata repository which is a part of the Metadata Management System.

**Enterprise Data Model** is the foundation for creating an Enterprise Data Catalog. You first create an Enterprise Data Model. Then you add various metadata to the entities and attributes in an Enterprise Data Model to build an Enterprise Data Catalog.

### Different ways that people use a Metadata Management System:

Different people collaborate with each other to author different pieces of metadata for a data domain

People curate the content by categorizing and classifying data using tags and taxonomies so that information can be found quickly in the Metadata Management System

Users review the different metadata in a Metadata Management System and rate the content and quality

### New terms
Metadata information that describes other data
Metadata Repository is a database that stores metadata
Enterprise Data Catalog is a consolidation or inventory of all the metadata

### Metadata management is critical to enabling good data governance.

Metadata is information about your data. Metadata helps you understand different aspects of the data in your company. Some of the insights you can gain from metadata:

What data exists in the company, and which IT system contains this data?

What are the business level definition and descriptions of data elements?

How good is the data quality of data elements and entities? What are the data quality thresholds?

Who are the users of the data? What do they use the data for? Who are the data owners and data stewards?

Who can access the data? What kind of access do they have?

What are the business and data quality rules and transformations applied to the data?

Where is the data created? Where is it stored? How is it published? Is it archived or deleted?

### Some of the key impacts of a good metadata management system:

With proper metadata management, companies **reduce the reliance on subject matter experts/IT personnel to identify the location of the information.**

Metadata management enables the creation of enterprise-level data definitions, **proper documentation of business rules, usage, and policies**

Metadata that was once scattered across the enterprise is now captured in a single repository that can be easily accessed by anyone in the company resulting in significant time savings and improved productivity

Metadata management identifies and eliminates redundancies and inconsistencies in data and processes.

### New terms
Data Owner Person who is responsible for data in a particular Data Domain

Data Quality Threshold Categorizes the data into different data quality levels
