# What is Data Governance

A typical enterprise consists of many IT systems used across multiple departments to perform critical business functions like day to day business operations and analytics. All these systems have data, which is a valuable asset that is shared across the enterprise. Therefore, this data needs to be effectively managed for business process improvement, enterprise analytics, security, and regulatory compliance.

**Data Governance is a set of policies, controls, and disciplines for the effective management of corporate data assets.**
Key disciplines of Data Governance are:

**Enterprise Data Modeling**
Provides a holistic view of the data in the company. Helps to understand all the data that exists in the company along with the relationships in the data.

**Metadata Management**
Provides information about the content of your data such as business rules, definitions, access policies, usage patterns, ownership, lineage and lifecycle. Also this information will be centralized for anyone in the company to easily access and use.

**Data Quality Management**
Provides continuous monitoring of data quality. Automated processes are setup and business rules are implemented to identify and fix data quality issues and monitor data quality.

**Master Data Management**
Provides consistency of datasets that are shared by multiple business-critical processes. Different variations of the same data that exists in different systems are consolidated into a single unified version.

Data Governance is the backbone of an Enterprise Data Management program. In a typical company, there are many systems, each for a different purpose. There is a lot of data in each system, and in some cases, the same data exists in multiple systems. Without proper data governance, many problems will happen when performing everyday business processes.

To prevent and resolve the different issues, your job as a Data Architect is to set up a Data Governance solution to manage your company's data assets effectively. There are many business benefits of implementing a Data Governance solution - a central repository for data and reports, providing accurate data for reports and analytics, establishing a 360° view of the customer, improving the efficiency of business processes, and creating new revenue opportunities and cost savings!!

## When To Use Or Not Use Data Governance

Data Governance is an enterprise-level program and needs heavy financial investment. Thus, it is a **very high visibility project** that is closely monitored by senior leadership in the company. Hence, as a Data Architect, you need to be mindful of when it is justified to implement Data Governance and not.

### Some scenarios that could hinder the success of data governance and/or when the investment is not sufficiently justified:

There is no executive sponsorship for a data governance program
People in some departments participate, and some don’t participate
Focus is on data that is not critical for analytics or business processes
Goal of the Data Governance program is to implement new technologies, and the data capabilities are already mature

**As a Data Architect, you should raise red flags in the above scenarios.**

### Some scenarios are a perfect opportunity for implementing Data Governance:

Data Governance is relatively new and has gained traction in the past 10 years or so. Before around 1990, companies did not regard data as an asset, and hence Data Governance didn’t really exist. Between around 1990 through 2010, companies started recognizing data as an asset. However, Data Governance has been more of an informal and siloed IT initiative. Data is cataloged without much business use. After around 2010, companies started shifting to data-driven business, and companies started treating data as one of the most valuable assets. Data Governance has become a growing trend, and Data Governance has become a collaborative effort between business and technical teams.

Companies are now investing more than ever into Data Governance, and this is an exciting time for you as a Data Architect!
