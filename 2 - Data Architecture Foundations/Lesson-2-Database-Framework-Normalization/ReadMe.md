Relational databases are basically of two types: transactional databases and data warehouse. In this lesson we will look at ER Modelling, used in transactional databases.



Data Model -- representations of a real object; abstract model created to structure data into a format that can be used to define a real-world object or concept.

Normalization -- Process of organizing data into a structure usable by a relational database

3rd Normal Form-- A common level of data normalization found in transactional relational databases. A data organization method.

Schema -- Physical blueprint of a database design

To build a relational model, we need entities, attributes, and relationships: 
Entities are concepts or items we want to collect data on. An entity has many attributes. The entities would be connected via relationships.

The three most common levels of relational modeling are conceptual, logical, and physical.

The conceptual model focuses solely on entities and how the entities relate

The logical model focuses is on entities, attributes, and relationships

The physical model adds data types, use computer-friendly naming conventions, and address relationships

Conceptual Model: A data model level, focused on what are the entities and how do they relate

Logical Model: A data model featuring entities, attributes, and their relationships

Physical Model: A data model featuring entities, attributes, data types, and their relationships. Entity and attribute names should also be computer friendly
