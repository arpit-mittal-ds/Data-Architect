# Notes - What is Data Architecture


Data architects are senior visionaries who translate business requirements into technology requirements and define data standards and principles. 

The data architect is responsible for visualizing and designing an organization's enterprise data management framework. This framework describes the processes used to plan, specify, enable, create, acquire, maintain, use, archive, retrieve, control, and purge data. 

The data architect also "provides a standard common business vocabulary, expresses strategic requirements, outlines high-level integrated designs to meet those requirements, and aligns with enterprise strategy and related business architecture

## Data architect skills

**A foundation in systems development.** Data architects must understand the system development life cycle, project management approaches, and requirements, design, and test techniques, Lambert says.

**Data modeling and design.** This is the core skill of the data architect and the most requested skill in data architect job descriptions, according to Lambert, who notes that this often includes SQL development and database administration.

**Established and emerging data technologies.** Data architects need to understand established data management and reporting technologies, and have some knowledge of columnar and NoSQL databases, predictive analytics, data visualization, and unstructured data.

**Communication and political savvy.** Data architects need people skills. They must be articulate, persuasive, and good salespeople, Lambert says, and they must conceive and portray the big data picture to others


Data architecture goes way beyond database design. Technology is a big part of the role, but providing solutions to business problems, that is what is at the heart of data architecture.

Think outside of the limitations of technology. Learn the business role you will be working with. Shadow some employees, ask questions, sit in on some meetings, even read up on the field. Your business partners will appreciate you showing a real interest in their work, and your insight will help guide you in providing better architected solutions for your business partners.

**What do Architects do**


The core of data architecture is finding the best answers to the following question: **what is the business trying to do and how can data help?**

This means that data architecture focuses on both the business side and the technical side. As a data architect, it is your job to understand both sides and to live on both sides. You need to be the bridge between business users and technology.

It's time to step out of your IT comfort zone!

## Data Architecture Characteristics

The main characteristics are:

**Business needs First:** Use technology to solve Business Problems. Focus on Business Problem rather than Technology.

**Data Governance:** Set of rules and standards designed to ensure proper stewardship of data. Remember: Who owns the data, Who manages the data, and Who can access the data

**Data Integrity:** Ensuring the data is accurate and consistent

**Data Retention:** Focused on how long data must be held. Set by either company policy also by government or industry mandates

**Flexibility:** Database design characteristic focused on multiple uses for data

**Scalability:** Database design characteristic focused on user and data load levels

## Business needs First

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119765261-498ad680-bef6-11eb-95f7-fdc4841ea104.png)

### Common business uses for databases

Three of the most common types: transactional, reporting, and computational.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119782109-202a7480-bf0f-11eb-9658-2bdba7721873.png)


**Transactional need:** the data is constantly being updated or added. 

The Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) database is designed to fulfill the transactional need.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119782236-43edba80-bf0f-11eb-9085-a1835e913753.png)


**Reporting need:** the need for reading. The data is not changed very frequently or rapidly. Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) database is designed to fulfill the reporting need. This kind of data exists in data warehouses where data may not be up to date but is stable for queries and reading tasks.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119782325-67b10080-bf0f-11eb-92ac-c5d15bc3a48e.png)


**Computational need:** the data is designed to facilitate heavy calculations.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119783596-b3b07500-bf10-11eb-91f9-60646d3c6046.png)


**OLTP vs. OLAP**
Think about how fast you want the data to be refreshed. If you need data to be refreshed rapidly and frequently, that is OLTP or transactional. If you don't need the data to be refreshed frequently, that's OLAP or reporting.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119782518-a0e97080-bf0f-11eb-8953-8f10c3cd8edc.png)

**Further Reading**

Below you will find a couple of great articles on OLAP vs OLTP databases.
[article-1](https://www.datawarehouse4u.info/OLTP-vs-OLAP.html)
[article-2](https://www.datawarehouse4u.info/OLTP-vs-OLAP.html)

**New terms**

Computational: a database designed to accommodate heavy or advanced mathematical calculations to be performed on the data

OLAP: Online analytical processing - a database designed for reporting and warehousing. Designed with the stability of data in mind. Data often updated in batches, can lag behind live data by minutes, hours, days, or even weeks

OLTP: Online transaction processing - a database designed for transactional needs. These databases are designed for constant updates and inputs of data

Reporting: in database terminology, reporting covers everything from static reports to dashboards. Reporting databases follow OLAP design

Transactional: a database designed with constant updating in mind. Follows OLTP design

Warehouse: in database terminology, a warehouse is an OLAP platform. Data warehouses are structured, meaning the data exists in column and row formatting


### Handling new customer's requests - ML, AI, Blockchain etc.....cutting edge technologies

Sometimes your client may send requests that don't fit their need. In this scenario, you can show them how much their idea would cost. You can also search for use cases similar and perform analysis to convince your client that their requests are not the best solution.

**sometimes just finding out that no one else is doing anything similar is enough**

## Data Governance

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119765737-21e83e00-bef7-11eb-8885-000505fc2ac2.png)

### Examples: 

Approach of Data Modeling while ensuring Data Security

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119774771-0b95ae80-bf06-11eb-9d54-4ca2ce5345ee.png)

While there are many ways to secure sensitive data this walkthrough showed you an example using table-level security. In the table-level security method, you need to move the sensitive data to a separate table and then map it to the rest of the tables. You can then limit user access to the table with sensitive data.

For those not familiar with the concept of table-level security in a database, here is a brief overview of the concept.

In order to access a database, a user needs to be given rights. These rights can be applied to the database as a whole, or restricted down to parts of the database. So if we take the example from the video. As the database manager, I could give you (as a user) rights to view the entire database, meaning every table in the database. If you were a doctor or nurse at the clinic, I might even give you rights to add data or edit existing data in the database. That would be called database-level security since I am applying the rights at the database level.

At table-level security however, we apply rights a little differently. If you were an office administrator at this clinic, I might give you rights to view the Patient, Doctor, and Visit tables only, and deny your rights to view the Drug Test table. When you logged into the database, you would see all the data found in the Patient, Doctor, and Visit tables, and you would not be able to see anything in the Drug Test table.

This is a very basic method of data security, but it is the method I recommend using in this class (especially in your final project), as it achieves the goal of securing a single data element without having to go into more advanced data security methodology.

### Further Reading
You will be covering data governance in greater detail in one of the later courses, so I chose to give you a really stripped down view of data governance. It really is the level of data governance I deal with in my job, as the greater details you will be learning about later (Master Data Management, Data Dictionaries) they are really the purview of the Data Governance Committee in my job. However, if you want a little sneak peek of what else Data Governance has to offer, here is a pretty good article. [click to read](https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/data-governance#:~:text=Data%20governance%20DG%20is%20the,and%20doesn't%20get%20misused)

### New terms
Database Administrator (DBA): technical position, often part of the IT infrastructure, that maintains the day to day functions of a database
Data Governance: Set of rules and standards designed to ensure proper stewardship of data. Remember: Who owns the data, Who manages the data, and Who can access the data
Single source of truth: a set of data deemed to go to reference when conflicting data is found in the system
Subject matter expert (SME): professional deemed by the organization to be an expert in a certain arena

## Exercise: Data Governance

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119777263-41886200-bf09-11eb-99d1-09e81b0790f2.png)

### 1. Which user rights setting prevents student from seeing grades?

### 2. How to build logic to allow teachers to only see grades in the classes in their respective departments ?

### Solution: Data Governance
This exercise was all about user access and protecting data. 

1. The important part to focus on is the fact that we want to prevent students from seeing grades.
The question states we want to prevent a student from seeing grades, so our focus should be on the table that holds grade data. And the question specifically mentions students, so other users should not be affected by this rule.

So for this question, the answer is to: **Revoke select rights on grade table for students.**

2. This one is a bit more complex, as it is not simply blocking access to a table. Instead, we are applying logic to limit access to specific data. Note, this kind of data security is usually performed at an application level, over top of the database security.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119777523-a17f0880-bf09-11eb-9aec-828151e3161f.png)

Using the picture above as reference: If the teacher's Department ID does not match the Class Number's Department ID, then Grade for that Class Number should not be visible to the teacher.


## Scalability and Flexibility

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119765806-3af0ef00-bef7-11eb-83fa-bc5587ffd6d3.png)

## Scalability

scalability is all about the amount of load, or demand, being given to the database. Whether it be more users, more data, or both, you need to be able to consider design options that will allow your database to scale up to the meet the need demand.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119779179-b9578c00-bf0b-11eb-9541-ed5f291cd621.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119779450-0b98ad00-bf0c-11eb-98bd-accc493ea06e.png)

### There are two approaches to scalability: sharding and replicating.

### Replicated database

Replicated databases are copies of the original database on separate servers. It offloads the main database by sending users to the replicated databases. Replication is for reading, not writing. Replication has a lag time, so the copies will not be as up to date as the original.
**If the issue is number of users - optimizing Reading** 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119779707-59adb080-bf0c-11eb-806d-324c79717a79.png)


### Sharded database

Sharding means to split the data across multiple servers. It is a great method for writing and inputting data because you split the writing load onto multiple databases. But reading from sharded databases is very slow since you have to visit multiple databases to retrieve the information.

**If the issue is amount of data - optimizing Writing**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119779882-819d1400-bf0c-11eb-85e0-c4b7d583c811.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119780042-ae512b80-bf0c-11eb-8b20-b82730ee3936.png)


## Flexibility

Flexibility is all about designing the database to meet multiple needs. This a is a common problem, so ask lots of questions in the early design phase to try to get a head start on this

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119779282-db510e80-bf0b-11eb-9506-f012867e0276.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119780153-d17bdb00-bf0c-11eb-9af4-56b9a5d40029.png)

## Exercise: Scalability and Flexibility

### Instruction

The superintendents of two districts have been asked to allow both students and parents to have read access to the database this year. The superintendents estimate this will result in an additional 15,000 to 30,000 new users accessing the database. They are concerned that this will cause a problem with database performance. You have been asked to explain how you plan to scale the database up to meet this increased user demand.

### Answer: 
The answer to this question lies in the fact the superintendents are concerned about meeting the demand for 10's of thousands of new users who will be reading the data.

And an increase in data reading demand should indicate database replication as the best solution to the problem. Remember, sharding is used when the amount of data being written to the system is the concern.


## Retention

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119765841-48a67480-bef7-11eb-91db-68e40179557e.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119767084-9623e100-bef9-11eb-8f93-e1138230bb79.png)



## Data Integrity

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/119765338-6d4e1c80-bef6-11eb-9237-d5da9e3d9d2f.png)

The main solution to the data integrity issue is to ensure information is only entered once. In addition, assigning unique IDs as an identifier ensures that each row is unique. This also increases data flexibility.

## Importance of Data Architecture

## Lesson Overview - This lesson has 4 major topics:

1. The **importance** of data architecture and enterprise data systems to almost every company.

2. The **benefits** of data architecture and enterprise data systems to almost every company.
        **Getting rid of silos**
        **Scaling**
        
3. The business and data **artifacts** of data architecture.

4. How **OLTP, ODS, and OLAP models** play a part in an organization's **ability to analyze and report.**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/121107135-c0a36180-c84a-11eb-9b44-4a672b5d9d73.png)


The diagram below shows how each step OLTP, ODS, and OLAP models play a part in an organization's ability to analyze and report. Each of the steps must be planned so the data can be ingested, then transformed in ways that allow it to be processed through the ODS and ultimately into the data warehouse. Once it is there, it can be queried and used in the analysis and in reports.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/121107045-8f2a9600-c84a-11eb-8820-87ad9e2bc452.png)

## What is Data Architecture

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/121109264-8fc52b80-c84e-11eb-91e8-37a5f674fda2.png)

### Data Silos
Why is this topic so important?

They can occur when local employees and local departments manage their own data, transactions, and analytics. Many companies find themselves with this scenario, which can be a challenge for collaboration or scaling.

Silos, both in people and in data, can lead to inefficient and ineffective business decisions.

They are difficult to integrate and sometimes cause inconsistent, duplicate, and incorrect data.

Costs and processes are also duplicated.

### The changing landscape of data architecture
As data grows in quantity and quality, what data architecture actually is evolves in definition based on changing data and technology landscape.

With leading-edge technologies such as these which are massively dependant upon and producers of data, the need for data architecture and data system design becomes even more important.

Internet of Things
Cloud Computing
Microservices
Advanced Analytics
Machine Learning
Artificial Intelligence
Blockchain



## Importance of [Data Architecture](https://rusty-alderson.medium.com/enterprise-data-architecture-c5c579b54abe)

Data Architecture provides a **Master Plan** of all assets related to data, systems, and process

### Why is a Master Plan necessary?

A Master Plan helps an organization take a hard look at what it is doing and how it is doing it

**1. Helps manage data and data sources:**

You probably know people who have some of the following on their own computers.

Spreadsheet data
Text file or Presentation slides
Stand-alone database

**2. Helps in capturing institutional knowledge**
The veterans in your organization have a vast amount of knowledge. Capturing that and incorporating it into the system preserves and takes advantage of that wealth of information.

**3. Indicate problems with data resulting in ineffective analytics**

### Important business trends

**These trends reinforce the need for data architecture.**

Data volumes are increasing

Numer of data sources is increasing

Many organizations are considering moving to the cloud

Data from different sources is not in a compatible format for use in their system

### What kinds of data systems can help?

An ODS(Operational Data Store) system can centrally store all the transactional enterprise data.

A DWH (data warehouse), by bringing all that data together into one system, can provide relative, up-to-date, and comprehensive information

### How do those systems help decision-makers?

This data provides information, at business stakeholder's fingertips, which enables them to execute business strategies and models. This can result in

**Increased revenues through**

Better customer service 

Faster customer service

Increased customer service

Ability to offer new services

**Decreased expenses through**

Streamlining systems

Eliminating duplicate efforts

Reducing bottlenecks

The hidden gem of designing data systems

The research involved in design a data system forces people across the organization to talk to each other and collaborate. Those discussions are gold to an organization.

### QUESTION
A multinational company is growing fast, establishing operations in multiple locations. What kind of challenges does the company face if data architecture is not a part of their strategic decisions?
1. Silo Bases Systems - Silo systems can result in multiple versions of data
2. Not managing incoming and outgoing data can be a major cause of disfunction in a company
3. Bad data quality can cause revenue loss

 Many companies in todays climate are in jeopardy of losing their edge unless they embrace data architecture
 
 ## Actionable Intelligence Insights
Most organizations want systems to

Help to identify opportunities to improve the productivity

Cleanse bad data anomalies

Use a Single Version of Truth to reduce or eliminate multiple copies(possibly inconsistent) of

Data Reports

Find hidden patterns

**Working towards an enterprise architecture**

Forces the distributed teams to work together by bringing their data together
 
Integrates disconnected silo systems for a common purpose

Increases professional and social collaboration helps build a strong business culture
Helps to execute business strategies
The Role of the Data Architect
Ultimately, it is your job to help motivate data owners by showing them how a well-planned and implemented data architecture helps them meet their business goals, both for their department and the organization

## Artifacts (Documents) of an Enterprise Data Architecture

### What artifacts are needed to design a good Data Architecture strategy?

To implement a good Data Architecture strategy, an organization has to create certain documents, known in the business as “artifacts”. Following is a list of the major documents to include:

Data dictionary: helps to standardize business vocabulary

Enterprise Data models: used to create an ODS (Operational Data Store). We will discuss ODS later in the course

Data flow: enable a smooth transition of data movements crossing various silos. We will discuss data flows later in the course

Data stewardship: specifies who can access what data

Dimensional models: used to create a data warehouse structure for effective reporting and analytics

Data sharing agreements: articulate who can access what data

These documents help provide a route map for data flows

**Business Artifacts**
Alongside the data-related documents above, on the business side, there is also some documentation that is necessary:

Business rules: Guard the boundaries of those data flows

Business concepts:  Help everyone to be on the same page

Business requirements: Help to decide and build reporting and analytics

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/121126605-cb222300-c86b-11eb-92df-010f7e97f156.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/121127101-9d89a980-c86c-11eb-8e7f-b1bb94b62163.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/121127136-abd7c580-c86c-11eb-9404-7632b7ce5622.png)

Standards are important for heterogeneous and distributed systems to communicate with each other. Standards help ensure data is effectively collected, maintained, and made available.

### Types of Standards

Data dictionaries standardize crucial details such as data fields, data types, and data lengths

Business rules ensure all departments follow the same processes,
 
Stewardship deals with data-sharing agreements among various departments, otherwise known as Governance

Security ensures the data is used properly according to the CRUD model. CRUD stands for Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete

Standardizing vendor products and their interfaces minimize the friction when trying to connect disparate systems to move the data back and forth.

As a result of implementing these standards, executive management and departmental heads are empowered to improve the business operations and execute new business strategies.

### Benefits of Standards

Avoids confusion and dissatisfaction of the stakeholders due to inconsistent and (possibly) incompatible/accessible data and information

Prevents data anomalies that result in effective report creation and analytics for your decision-makers.

Ensures compatibility when integrating data during mergers and acquisitions

When data standards are not implemented, the resulting structure contributes to silos being formed.

Addressing these issues is one of the key elements of importance in bringing Data Architecture into an enterprise.

### Data Flow Models
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/121127485-30c2df00-c86d-11eb-8ebe-7db4eb30e55d.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/121127534-42a48200-c86d-11eb-81cd-9c49985eec09.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/121127551-47693600-c86d-11eb-91e3-02970503d9d1.png)

### Models

**Conceptual models:** We are all familiar with social media. Data flows in these systems can be represented by conceptual models.

Logical models represent business concepts within a relationship diagram. The primary relationships are 1 to 1, 1 to many, many to many. Think about how your Customer Rep has many Customers. Each of those Customers orders many different products, and can submit many orders

ER models are physical implementations of Data Definition Language (DDL) statements given an RDBMS product, such as Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server. These are used in OLTP systems.

Dimensional models(databases tables) provide descriptive key information, which should contain non-transactional data. Examples are Customer, Employee, Product, Date, Location, etc., but not the Order table. Dimensional models are used to design a data warehouse either using a Star schema or Snowflake schema. These are used in OLAP systems
Once the system has been created, an analytical tool, such as Power BI or Tableau can be used to build an interactive analytical model for visualization.


### Why are Artifacts important?

Capture knowledge so new employees can be trained
Document the tribal and institutional knowledge of experienced and critical employees, as well as existing employees
Reduce business risk by documenting the business systems and processes. If some key employees leave the company, without having documentation of their knowledge, it is a big risk to the business.
Reduce costs by understanding the data and business processes in order to avoid having ineffective and inefficient systems.
Employee productivity increase with well-defined and understood systems and processes


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/121126663-e12fe380-c86b-11eb-8276-42bdad153c5f.png)


 
 ## Unknown Edge Cases
Any organization is going to face scenarios they were not expecting or were unprepared for.

How do we handle these? The two most important elements are:

By being flexible
By being adaptable
A well-planned Data Architecture that keeps track of all inputs and outputs helps reduce the likelihood of those scenarios

### Dynamic Definition of Data Architecture
Those same unexpected scenarios and unknowns mentioned above are also part of the reason that there is not really a single, agreed-upon definition of Data Architecture.

Think of all the components that make up a business

Business models
Strategies
Personnel
Processes
Systems
Technology
These are constantly changing. Big Data adds even more complexity.

Data Architecture must change along with that, hence the dynamic definition.
 
 ### The benefits of data architecture to almost every company
Eliminating silos
Scaling
Being adaptable
Being flexible
Reducing costs *Becoming more efficient

 ### Tips to succeed in Data Architect:
If you are not, learn to be a people person

Learn how departmental business units work

Be a continuous learner about newer technologies

Master the craft of improving the performance and scalability
