## 

Data architecture goes way beyond database design. Technology is a big part of the role, but providing solutions to business problems, that is what is at the heart of data architecture.

Think outside of the limitations of technology. Learn the business role you will be working with. Shadow some employees, ask questions, sit in on some meetings, even read up on the field. Your business partners will appreciate you showing a real interest in their work, and your insight will help guide you in providing better architected solutions for your business partners.

**What do Architects do**


The core of data architecture is finding the best answers to the following question: **what is the business trying to do and how can data help?**

This means that data architecture focuses on both the business side and the technical side. As a data architect, it is your job to understand both sides and to live on both sides. You need to be the bridge between business users and technology.

It's time to step out of your IT comfort zone!

## Data Architecture Characteristics

The main characteristics are:

**Business need**

**Data Governance:** Set of rules and standards designed to ensure proper stewardship of data. Remember: Who owns the data, Who manages the data, and Who can access the data

**Data Integrity:** Ensuring the data is accurate and consistent

**Data Retention:** Focused on how long data must be held. Set by either company policy also by government or industry mandates

**Flexibility:** Database design characteristic focused on multiple uses for data

**Scalability:** Database design characteristic focused on user and data load levels

The main solution to the data integrity issue is to ensure information is only entered once. In addition, assigning unique IDs as an identifier ensures that each row is unique. This also increases data flexibility.
