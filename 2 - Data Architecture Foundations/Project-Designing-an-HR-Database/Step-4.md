This last step is called Above and Beyond. In this step, I have proposed 3 challenges for you to complete, which are above and beyond the scope of the project. This is a chance to flex your coding muscles and show everyone how good you really are.

These challenge steps will bring your project even more in line with a real-world project, as these are the kind of “finishing touches” that will make your database more usable. Imagine building a car without air conditioning or turn signals. Sure, it will work, but who would want to drive it.

I encourage you to take on these challenges in this course and any future courses you take. I designed these challenges to be a challenge to your current abilities, but I ensured they are not an unattainable challenge. Remember, these challenges are completely optional - you can pass the project by doing none of them, or just some of them, but I encourage you to at least attempt them!

Challenge 1
Create a view that returns all employee attributes; results should resemble the initial Excel file.

Views are what most users work with when using databases. Tables are coded in machine friendly 3NF, but views allow you to create a human-readable alternative for users.

Challenge 2
Create a stored procedure with parameters that return current and past jobs (include employee name, job title, department, manager name, start and end date for the position) when given an employee name.

Just like views, stored procedures make the database appear to work effortlessly. Instead of creating a complicated query, they just need to provide a name to a stored procedure to get the results they want.

Challenge 3
Implement user security on the restricted salary attribute.

Creating a separate table for salary makes applying security rules for that information possible. However, just creating the table is only step one. Create a user name NonMgr and REVOKE that user’s rights from viewing the salary table.
