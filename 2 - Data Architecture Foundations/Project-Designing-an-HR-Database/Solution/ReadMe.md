# SOLUTION

## STEP 1

## STEP 2 -  DATABASE DESIGN

**Using the dataset provided, along with the requirements gathered in step one, I designed the database in 3NF.

Using Lucidchart, I created 3 entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) to show how I developed the final design for the provided data.**


## CONCEPTUAL DATA MODEL

**This is the most general level of data modeling. At the conceptual level, I just thought about creating entities that represent business objects for the database.**

## LOGICAL DATA MODEL

**The logical model is the next level of refinement from the conceptual ERD. At this point, I have normalized the data to the 3NF. Attributes are also be listed now in the ERD. I am still using human-friendly entity and attribute names in the logical model, and while relationship lines are present, Crow's foot notation is still not mentioned.**

## PHYSICAL DATA MODEL

**The physical model is what will be built in the database. Each entity represents a database table, complete with column names and data types.**
