## 1. Factors that affect Database Performance

### Cache and Indexing

While many of the aspects affecting database performance are generally out of the hands of data architect, we focused on two common aspects you should be aware of:

Cache and Indexing.

Both can improve database performance, and you should be aware of the uses of both technologies.

**Cache**

Cache is a place to store commonly used data in high-performance memory so the future queries for that data can be run faster.

### There are three types of cache:

**Internal cache:** internal device, limited size, fastest memory, very expensive financially.

**External cache:** external device, high-speed memory, upgrading the size of memory is more affordable than internal cache.

**Enterprise cache:** external device, designed to work for multiple databases, very expensive.

**Indexing**

## 2. Storage and File Systems

**Storage algorithm**

It is purely academic. As a data architect, you will not be developing or designing data storage algorithms, but knowing the basics of the most common data storage approaches may come in handy in the interview one day.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/122493566-44b7cf00-d02b-11eb-830f-c3318a8e38eb.png)

### Heap

**Heap files:** Heap files are a group of unordered lists of records where new records are appended to the end of the existing lists. This algorithm allows very fast writing and is perfect for the bulk loading of data. But it has poor sorting performance since the data is not ordered, which makes retrieving specific data very slow.

Great for bulk record ingestion, but not great for lookups

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/122493607-56997200-d02b-11eb-8e10-e589e345e7d8.png)

### Hash Buckets

Buckets divide memory into pages and when a record comes in, a hash function (math function) is calculated to determine which page it goes on. This algorithm ensures more even distribution of records across the memory. It is **good for locating specific records (allow for fast lookup based on keys)** since it creates a kind of key index. But it is not good for large data retrieval, since it has no sequential storage (meaning records are not stored in order, one after the other, they are instead stored across multiple pages based on their hash value).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/122493703-7c267b80-d02b-11eb-908d-9043750cd855.png)

### B+ Trees

B+ tree is the **most commonly used storage algorithm.** It stores records in pages as well, but it indexes the record in a binary tree. It allows fast search due to the full index and binary design. It can also be easily scaled up for large databases. However, for stable, not volatile data, a heap file may work better since heap has less overhead.

### Data Storage hardware

**Storage media**

**Tape:** Tape is the earliest form of storage, and it is the slowest. It is nowadays usually relegated to **archive data only.**

**Hard drive** (spinning disc, SSD): Hard drive is the most common storage option. SSD is multiple times faster than a spinning disc.

**In-memory (RAM)**: In-memory data is very fast but very expensive. You need to limit the use of in-memory storage to the application that really requires it.

## 3. Build a functioning database

DDL: Data definition language - a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, and stored procedures

DML: Data manipulation language - a set of SQL commands used to manipulate data inside of a database

## Use DDL to Create A Database

## 4. Common Data ingestion Methods: ETL, Direct Feed, Pipeline, API

Data ingestion is just as important as database design, perhaps more so. An empty database is not much of use to anybody. In this section, we covered four of the most common methods of data ingestion.

Few of the different data ingestion methods include API, ETL, Pipeline, and direct connection.

**ETL**

ETL is short for extract, transform, load. ETL starts with data from an external source, then the data is extracted and put into a staging area such as a table, the data is then transformed to meet the requirements of the destination. Finally, the data is loaded into a destination database.

ETL is the most common data ingestion method. It is **usually be done as a batch job** to move data from any format into a database. It is great for large loads of data.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/122509873-e0efcf00-d047-11eb-80dd-1792a0b2cf3f.png)

**Direct feed**

Direct feeds are 1 to 1 connections between databases. They can be linked servers if you work with MS SQL. Data is pushed to the destination or pulled from the destination server via queries. It is quick and easy to use but not great for large data loads.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/122510090-4fcd2800-d048-11eb-815a-a97d04ef8d13.png)


**Pipeline**
A data pipeline is a series of steps that takes data from various sources, reformat it possibly, and move it to data destinations. It is usually broken down into three steps: taking data from the data sources, processing data, and moving data to the  destination. It is usually not managed by batch jobs. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/122510134-6a070600-d048-11eb-90d7-06c7219de1c7.png)

?? ETL are generally used for batch jobs only where as data pipelines are used for real time or near real time updates.

**API**
The application programming interface (API) is an interface between an application or a website and the database. It allows customers to safely access the database.

The API allows users to run only the pre-approved commands against your database. It is fast, secure, and used heavily on websites and mobile apps.

### ETL, Direct Feed, Pipeline, API Walkthrough/Exercise

**-- create stage table**
Create table Stg(
player varchar(50),
team varchar(50),
position varchar(50));

**-- load data into stage table**
Insert into Stg
Values ('Bob', 'Browns', 'Quarterback'),
('Tyrell', 'Reds', 'Full Back'),
('Darrin', 'Blues', 'Kicker'),
('Frank', 'Reds', 'Quarterback');

**Note that there is no need to define PK, FK or 3NF for staging tables. Staging tbales are loaded with raw data from upstream systems.**
**Following are the ODS tables where data is in 3NF**

**-- create a Team table**

Create table Team (
team_id serial primary key,
team_nm varchar(50));

**-- create a Position Table**
Create table Position (
position_id serial primary key,
position_nm varchar(50));

**-- create a Player table**
Create table Player (
player_id serial primary key,
player_nm varchar(50),
team_id int references Team(team_id),
position_id int references Position(position_id));

**-- load data into Team table**
Insert into Team(team_nm)
Select distinct team from Stg;

**no need to insert value for id, it will be auto-incremented.

**--load data into Position table**
Insert into Position(position_nm)
Select distinct position from Stg;

**since player table has foriegn keys to poistion and team tables, position and team tables should be loaded first.** 

**--insert into Player table**
Insert into Player(player_nm, team_id, position_id)
Select s.player, t.team_id, p.position_id
From stg as s
Join team as t 
On s.team = t.team_nm
Join position as p 
On s.position = p.position_nm;

### Another small example

**Convert to 3NF**
create new database objects based on the 3NF transformation
move the data from the stage_table to the new objects you created

**Business Rules**
every student will take more than one class, so a mapping table will be needed to make this database work

**Solution**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/122521642-6ed3b600-d058-11eb-8745-cb92f8515c9d.png)

CREATE TABLE Student (
student_id SERIAL primary key,
student_name varchar(50));

CREATE TABLE Teacher (
teacher_id  SERIAL primary key,
teacher_name varchar(50));

CREATE TABLE Class (
class_id  SERIAL primary key,
class_name varchar(50));

CREATE TABLE Class_Sch (
student_id int REFERENCES Student(student_id),
teacher_id int REFERENCES Teacher(teacher_id),
class_id int REFERENCES Class(class_id),
primary key (student_id, teacher_id, class_id));

**Mapping tables such as Class_Sch and Player helps in removing duplicate data from other tables**

### Questions: schedule ??
should we have separate pipeline / job to load staging tables and ODS tables ?....Or shud we have one job with first task to update staging tables and then next task to update ODS table.
should we have foreign key constraints in ODS with big data ??
