You have learned how to extract data from source systems into staging and then from staging to ODS.

In this lesson, You will learn

The extraction process from ODS to the data warehouse.
The different types of schemas available when creating a data warehouse.
Types of dimensions and fact tables and why and how are they different and important
Once the data warehouse is up and running, then most importantly, you will write SQL queries for the purpose of reporting. This reporting is vital for decision-makers and leaders to see patterns and intelligent insights.

## Data Warehouse

All the data that is collected and managed by an organization can be stored in a centrally accessed system. This system ensures a Single Version of Truth for your data and provides all users access to the same data. This system can be used to identify trends, patterns, and outliers in the data. Both standard queries and custom queries can be accessed.

### Benefits of a DWH:

The data warehouse is used by everyone to find information, so it is **optimized for reads.**

**Historical data** can be used to find clues about customer behavior. For example: Why customers are withdrawing their subscriptions.

Power users can write **ad-hoc custom queries**

Users trust data warehouse reports, which is cleansed and valued as a **Single Version of Truth**

The End is in Sight
You have seen the diagram above in earlier lessons, but it makes sense to revisit it now. The data warehouse supports the reporting that is the ultimate goal of the Data Architect. We have said many times throughout the course, it is the pot at the end of the rainbow. Decision-makers can now dive deep into the data to find hidden trends and other valuable information.


## Why Data Warehousing Matters


The Value of Data
Especially in unpredictable times, business leaders need access to their data to provide up to date, easy to access, and well-organized data to help provide insights to help navigate based on factual data, and not emotion.

Insightful reporting data
A data warehouse can provide insightful reporting data from across the entire organization.

Important decisions can be made such as
Selling or closing certain business units
Merging some departments to minimize the costs
Acquiring an external company to fill an unseen need
Opening branches to enter into new markets
Productivity can be increased
by understanding the perspective from multiple departmental perspectives. Inefficiencies can be identified and addressed.
What-if scenarios using clean enterprise data sets can be run to innovate possibilities
Up to date and factual data related to revenue and expenses can be used to manage profits
Case Study: The impact of COVID
A data warehouse is even more important in these unprecedented situations:

Several big tech companies crossed the $1 trillion market capitalization recently.
During the period of COVID, a top tech company doubled its market cap to $2 trillion. when many companies are struggling to survive.
Yet, some companies lost revenue. How is that possible?

One of the reasons some companies were able to thrive during COVID time was that their Data Architecture was in place and decision-makers had access to up-to-date data from all aspects of the organization. The Source of Truth data provided reports that allowed them to understand their exact situation, and could plan accordingly.
