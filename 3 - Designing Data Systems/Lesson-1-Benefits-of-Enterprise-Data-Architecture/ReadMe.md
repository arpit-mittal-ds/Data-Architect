The diagram below shows how each step OLTP, ODS, and OLAP models play a part in an organization's ability to analyze and report. Each of the steps must be planned so the data can be ingested, then transformed in ways that allow it to be processed through the ODS and ultimately into the data warehouse. Once it is there, it can be queried and used in the analysis and in reports.
