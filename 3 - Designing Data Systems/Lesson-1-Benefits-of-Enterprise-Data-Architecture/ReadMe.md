# Notes - Importance of Data Architecture

## Lesson Overview - This lesson has 4 major topics:

1. The **importance** of data architecture and enterprise data systems to almost every company.

2. The **benefits** of data architecture and enterprise data systems to almost every company.
        **Getting rid of silos**
        **Scaling**
        
3. The business and data **artifacts** of data architecture.

4. How **OLTP, ODS, and OLAP models** play a part in an organization's **ability to analyze and report.**

The diagram below shows how each step OLTP, ODS, and OLAP models play a part in an organization's ability to analyze and report. Each of the steps must be planned so the data can be ingested, then transformed in ways that allow it to be processed through the ODS and ultimately into the data warehouse. Once it is there, it can be queried and used in the analysis and in reports.

## What is Data Architecture

### Data Silos
Why is this topic so important?

They can occur when local employees and local departments manage their own data, transactions, and analytics. Many companies find themselves with this scenario, which can be a challenge for collaboration or scaling.

Silos, both in people and in data, can lead to inefficient and ineffective business decisions.

They are difficult to integrate and sometimes cause inconsistent, duplicate, and incorrect data.

Costs and processes are also duplicated.

### The changing landscape of data architecture
As data grows in quantity and quality, what data architecture actually is evolves in definition based on changing data and technology landscape.

With leading-edge technologies such as these which are massively dependant upon and producers of data, the need for data architecture and data system design becomes even more important.

Internet of Things
Cloud Computing
Microservices
Advanced Analytics
Machine Learning
Artificial Intelligence
Blockchain



## Importance of [Data Architecture](https://rusty-alderson.medium.com/enterprise-data-architecture-c5c579b54abe)

Data Architecture provides a **Master Plan** of all assets related to data, systems, and process

### Why is a Master Plan necessary?

A Master Plan helps an organization take a hard look at what it is doing and how it is doing it

**1. Helps manage data and data sources:**

You probably know people who have some of the following on their own computers.

Spreadsheet data
Text file or Presentation slides
Stand-alone database

**2. Helps in capturing institutional knowledge**
The veterans in your organization have a vast amount of knowledge. Capturing that and incorporating it into the system preserves and takes advantage of that wealth of information.

**3. Indicate problems with data resulting in ineffective analytics**

### Important business trends

**These trends reinforce the need for data architecture.**

Data volumes are increasing

Numer of data sources is increasing

Many organizations are considering moving to the cloud

Data from different sources is not in a compatible format for use in their system

### What kinds of data systems can help?

An ODS(Operational Data Store) system can centrally store all the transactional enterprise data.

A DWH (data warehouse), by bringing all that data together into one system, can provide relative, up-to-date, and comprehensive information

### How do those systems help decision-makers?

This data provides information, at business stakeholder's fingertips, which enables them to execute business strategies and models. This can result in

**Increased revenues through**

Better customer service 

Faster customer service

Increased customer service

Ability to offer new services

**Decreased expenses through**

Streamlining systems

Eliminating duplicate efforts

Reducing bottlenecks

The hidden gem of designing data systems

The research involved in design a data system forces people across the organization to talk to each other and collaborate. Those discussions are gold to an organization.

### QUESTION
A multinational company is growing fast, establishing operations in multiple locations. What kind of challenges does the company face if data architecture is not a part of their strategic decisions?
1. Silo Bases Systems - Silo systems can result in multiple versions of data
2. Not managing incoming and outgoing data can be a major cause of disfunction in a company
3. Bad data quality can cause revenue loss

 Many companies in todays climate are in jeopardy of losing their edge unless they embrace data architecture
