# Notes - Importance of Data Architecture

## Lesson Overview - This lesson has 4 major topics:

1. The **importance** of data architecture and enterprise data systems to almost every company.

2. The **benefits** of data architecture and enterprise data systems to almost every company.
        **Getting rid of silos**
        **Scaling**
        
3. The business and data **artifacts** of data architecture.

4. How **OLTP, ODS, and OLAP models** play a part in an organization's **ability to analyze and report.**

The diagram below shows how each step OLTP, ODS, and OLAP models play a part in an organization's ability to analyze and report. Each of the steps must be planned so the data can be ingested, then transformed in ways that allow it to be processed through the ODS and ultimately into the data warehouse. Once it is there, it can be queried and used in the analysis and in reports.

### Data Silos
Why is this topic so important?

They can occur when local employees and local departments manage their own data, transactions, and analytics. Many companies find themselves with this scenario, which can be a challenge for collaboration or scaling.

Silos, both in people and in data, can lead to inefficient and ineffective business decisions.

They are difficult to integrate and sometimes cause inconsistent, duplicate, and incorrect data.

Costs and processes are also duplicated.

### The changing landscape of data architecture
As data grows in quantity and quality, what data architecture actually is evolves in definition based on changing data and technology landscape.

With leading-edge technologies such as these which are massively dependant upon and producers of data, the need for data architecture and data system design becomes even more important.

Internet of Things
Cloud Computing
Microservices
Advanced Analytics
Machine Learning
Artificial Intelligence
Blockchain
