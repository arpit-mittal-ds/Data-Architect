# Project - Design a Data Warehouse for Reporting and OLAP

In this project, 

I created end to end data architecture, 

built ingestion of data from Yelp and Climatic source systems, 

designed Operational Data Store and Data warehouse systems, 

and transformed data from staging to ODS,

and finally from ODS to data warehouse system. 



**Yelp** source carries a list of businesses, restaurants, its reviews and ratings. 

Climatic data source keeps track of temperature and precipitation data. 

Both of these websites are independent sources and not related to each other. 

The final **objective** of this project was to write appropriate SQL to **find the impact of weather on restaurant ratings.**
