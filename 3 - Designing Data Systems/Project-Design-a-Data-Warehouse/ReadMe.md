## Overview
In this project, I used actual YELP and climate datasets in order to analyze the effects the weather has on customer reviews of restaurants. 

The data for temperature and precipitation observations are from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-D) database. 

I used a leading industry cloud-native data warehouse system called Snowflake for all aspects of the project and applied the skills that I had acquired in this Designing Data Systems Course to architect and design a Data Warehouse for the purpose of reporting and online analytical processing (OLAP).



**Yelp** source carries a list of businesses, restaurants, its reviews and ratings. 

Climatic data source keeps track of temperature and precipitation data. 

Both of these websites are independent sources and not related to each other. 

The final **objective** of this project was to write appropriate SQL to **find the impact of weather on restaurant ratings.**

use actual YELP and climate datasets in order to analyze the effects the weather has on customer reviews of restaurants. The data for temperature and precipitation observations are from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-D) database. Students will use a leading industry cloud-native data warehouse system called Snowflake for all aspects of the project.

Students will then apply the skills they have acquired in the preceding Designing Data Systems Course to architect and design a Data Warehouse DWH for the purpose of reporting and online analytical processing (OLAP).

In this project, 

I created end to end data architecture, 

built ingestion of data from Yelp and Climatic source systems, 

designed Operational Data Store and Data warehouse systems, 

and transformed data from staging to ODS,

and finally from ODS to data warehouse system.
