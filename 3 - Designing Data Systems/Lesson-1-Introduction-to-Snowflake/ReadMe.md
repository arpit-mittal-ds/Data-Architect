### Source of data - [CitiBike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)

## Steps for the lab exercise:

This lab exercise is based on the analytics team at Citi Bike, a real citywide bike share system in New York City, USA. This team wants to run analytics on data to better understand their riders and how to serve them best.

### Step 1 - Load structured .csv data from rider transactions into Snowflake

This data comes from Citi Bike internal transactional systems.

Let’s start by preparing to load the structured data on Citi Bike rider transactions into Snowflake.

We are using the COPY command and S3 storage for this module in a manual process so you can see and learn from the steps involved. In the real-world, a customer would likely use an automated process or ETL product to make the data loading process fully automated and much easier. 

**1.1 Create a Database and Table** - First, let’s create a database called CITIBIKE that will be used for loading the structured data.
At the top of the UI select the “Databases” tab. Then click on “Create” and name the database “CITIBIKE” and click “Finish”.

**DDL operations are free!** Note that all the DDL operations we have done so far do NOT require compute resources, so we can create all our objects for free.

**1.2 Create an External Stage** - We are working with structured, comma-delimited data that has already been staged in a public, external S3 bucket. Before we can use this data, we first need to create a Stage that specifies the location of our external bucket.

**1.3 Create a File Format** - Before we can load the data into Snowflake, we have to create a File Format that matches the data structure.
At the top of the Snowflake UI, click the Worksheets tab. You should see the worksheet
with all the SQL we loaded in a prior step.

**1.4 create a Warehouse/Compute for Data Loading.** 
Snowflake’s compute nodes are called Warehouses and they can be dynamically sized up or out according to workload, whether the workload be loading data, running a query, or performing a DML operation. Each workload can have its own data warehouse so there is no resource contention.

**The Warehouses tab** is where you set up and manage compute resources (virtual warehouses) to load or query data in Snowflake. Note a warehouse called “COMPUTE_WH (XL)” already exists in your environment.

**1.5 Run a COPY command to load the data into the TRIPS table we created earlier**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/121169273-2cabb700-c897-11eb-8cd5-1f69c37e1a81.png)

### Step 2 - Create a New Warehouse for Data Analytics

Let’s assume the Citi Bike team wants to ensure no resource contention between their data loading/ETL workloads and the analytical end users using BI tools to query Snowflake. Snowflake can easily do this by assigning different, appropriately-sized warehouses to different workloads. 

Since Citi Bike already has a warehouse for data loading, let’s create a new warehouse for the end users running analytics. We will then use this warehouse to perform analytics.

**Run the Query in Worksheet to look at some basic hourly statistics on Citi Bike usage**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/121298312-fe7db400-c936-11eb-9acc-4490db5f10ef.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/121305725-499cc480-c941-11eb-920f-f92b9910e7ff.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/121305800-5e795800-c941-11eb-807c-c1acbfcba133.png)



Snowflake has a result cache that holds the results of every query executed in the past 24 hours. These are available across warehouses, so query results returned to one user are available to any other user on the system who executes the same query, provided the underlying data has not changed. Not only do these repeated queries return extremely fast, but they also use no compute credits

### Step 3 - Load weather data in JSON format held in a public S3 bucket

The JSON data consists of weather information provided by [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) detailing the historical weather conditions of New York City from 2016-07-05 to 2019-06-25.

**Create a Database and Table**

create database weather;

**Set the context appropriately within the Worksheet.**
use role sysadmin;
use warehouse compute_wh;
use database weather;
use schema public;


create table json_weather_data (v variant);
**Semi-Structured Data Magic** - Snowflake’s **VARIANT** data type allows Snowflake to ingest semi-structured data without having to pre-define the schema.

**Create an External Stage**

Via the Worksheet create a stage from where the unstructured data is stored on AWS S3.

create stage nyc_weather
url = 's3://snowflake-workshop-lab/weather-nyc';

Via the worksheet, run a COPY command to load the data into the
JSON_WEATHER_DATA table

copy into json_weather_data 
from @nyc_weather 
file_format = (type=json);

select * from json_weather_data limit 10;

### Step 4 - Create a View and query the semi-structured data using SQL dot notation

A View allows the result of a query to be accessed as if it were a table.

**Views can help you:** 
- present data to end users in a cleaner manner (like in this lab we will present “ugly” JSON in a columnar format), 

- limit what end users can view in a source table for privacy/security reasons, or write more modular SQL.

There are also **Materialized Views** in which SQL results are stored, almost as though the results were a table. This allows faster access, but requires storage
space. Materialized Views require Snowflake Enterprise Edition or higher.

Use **SQL dot notation** to pull out values at lower levels in the JSON hierarchy. This allows us to treat each field as if it were a column in a relational table.

### Step 5 - Run a query that joins the JSON data to the TRIPS data

We will now join the JSON weather data to our CITIBIKE.PUBLIC.TRIPS data to determine the
answer to our original question of how weather impacts the number of rides.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/121306676-7b625b00-c942-11eb-9183-64fc370d555c.png)


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68102477/121306916-c41a1400-c942-11eb-8481-c56eee2d08de.png)

The Citi Bike initial goal was to see if there was any correlation between the number of bike rides and weather by analyzing both ridership and weather data. 
Per the table above we have a clear answer. 
As one would imagine, the number of trips is significantly higher when the weather is good!
