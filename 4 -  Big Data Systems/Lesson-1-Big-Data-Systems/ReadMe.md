# Notes

There are two different roles in the industry: Big Data Engineer and a Big Data Architect. This course is designed with the focus on Data Architecture

You can think of a **Big Data Architect as a bridge between the business and/or technical leadership** of the company and the actual engineering team, working with the leadership to understand requirements better, propose solutions, provide a rationale.

## Course Overview - The course is divided into 5 lessons and a final project.

1. We will begin our journey by looking at the characteristics of Big Data, its business value, and how companies are using Big Data today.

2. Next, we study the most popular storage and processing frameworks.....aka...Big Data ecosystem components

3. Next, we will dive deep into NoSQL, how it differs from traditional relational databases, how to model, and what the tool interface looks like

4. Finally, we will talk about the benefits, challenges, design patterns of Data Lake technology

5. Your final project is based on a real-world scenario that will require you to think like an architect and build an end-to-end data lake system.

### The Course Learning Objectives are:

Identify the characteristics of big data and the business value of big data.

Evaluate the different storage and processing frameworks to work with Big Data and apply each to the appropriate use case.

Identify use cases for NoSQL databases and create a NoSQL data model

Design a scalable data lake architecture using design patterns [for big data]

## Big Data

 - is not just a single technology but more so an entire field; hence it is difficult to precisely define; some even refer to it as a concept.
 
 - provides ways to work with massive data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.

### Big Data Analytics provide value to companies in the following ways:

Improved products and service

Cost reduction and revenue increase

Faster, better decision making by executive teams

Using their data to identify new opportunities leads to smarter business moves, more efficient operations, higher profits, and happier customers.
