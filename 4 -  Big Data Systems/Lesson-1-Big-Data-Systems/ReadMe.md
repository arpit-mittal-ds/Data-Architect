# Notes

There are two different roles in the industry: Big Data Engineer and a Big Data Architect. This course is designed with the focus on Data Architecture

You can think of a **Big Data Architect as a bridge between the business and/or technical leadership** of the company and the actual engineering team, working with the leadership to understand requirements better, propose solutions, provide a rationale.

## Course Overview - The course is divided into 5 lessons and a final project.

1. We will begin our journey by looking at the characteristics of Big Data, its business value, and how companies are using Big Data today.

2. Next, we study the most popular storage and processing frameworks.....aka...Big Data ecosystem components

3. Next, we will dive deep into NoSQL, how it differs from traditional relational databases, how to model, and what the tool interface looks like

4. Finally, we will talk about the benefits, challenges, design patterns of Data Lake technology

5. Your final project is based on a real-world scenario that will require you to think like an architect and build an end-to-end data lake system.

### The Course Learning Objectives are:

Identify the characteristics of big data and the business value of big data.

Evaluate the different storage and processing frameworks to work with Big Data and apply each to the appropriate use case.

Identify use cases for NoSQL databases and create a NoSQL data model

Design a scalable data lake architecture using design patterns [for big data]

## Big Data

 - is not just a single technology but more so an entire field; hence it is difficult to precisely define; some even refer to it as a concept.
 
 - provides ways to work with **massive data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.**

### 4Vs" of Big Data

Big Data problems should have one or more of the following characteristics. These are called "4Vs" of Big Data.

Volume - Refers to the size of the data (Big Data processes hundreds of gigabytes to petabytes)
Example: Mobile phone carriers

Velocity - refers to the speed at which data is being generated.
For example social media sites, IoT devices, and connected cars

Variety - Data from multiple sources and in different formats (and type).
example: Healthcare

Veracity - Data in doubt. Incorrect, inconsistent, or missing data.

## Horizontal and Vertical Scaling

Scaling up and down

Vertical Scaling: You either buy (and replace the old one) new upgraded hardware. Or you upgrade the hardware specs (CPU, RAM, Graphics, Storage, Networking, etc) of the existing hardware (server)

Horizontal Scaling: Buy a large number of machines. You add more machines to your existing resource set.

In vertical scaling, you will have a single node. In horizontal scaling, you will have multiple nodes connected together in a network (called a cluster of nodes)

### Vertical Scaling

In order to handle the increased demands of bigger data, we can scale vertically, which means we can increase the capacity of existing hardware or software by adding additional resources, including processing power, storage, memory, and even network.

Keep in mind, you can only get as big as the size of the physical server

Technically, we can also "scale" our Relational Databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB. What that means is you can increase the underlying hardware configurations.

**Advantages of Vertical Scaling**

Easy to manage and implement

Reduced software, licensing, and operating costs

Less administrative efforts

Lower cooling costs

Easy to manage security

**Disadvantages**

Limited scaling

Can be a single point of failure

Longer downtime during maintenance

Upper limit on hardware upgrades

Hardware upgrades themselves can be costly

### Horizontal Scaling


You can enhance the performance of the server node by adding more instances of the server to the existing pool of servers

When we do this, we are not actually changing the capacity of the individual server, but we actually decrease the load on a specific server by distributing the load

We do this with the help of distributed file systems, clustering, and load balancing.

Examples of horizontally scalable systems: HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, MongoDB, Amazon DynamoDB.

There are workarounds to overcome disadvantages of horizontal scaling.

### Exercise: Scenario

An electronic device manufacturing company sells its products online via its website. The company has 3 tier web architecture where the first layer is the front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), the middle layer is the application server processing incoming requests from the front-end, and the third layer is the database layer. The company is currently using a single Postgres SQL database server to store product and order information. Last year, during a holiday sales event, the company announced aggressive discounts to promote their product. Too many customers tried to visit the website. However, the database could not handle millions of concurrent requests and crashed. The company lost customer trust and revenue. The company's CTO has directed you to research and suggest 3-5 techniques that can be implemented to scale the database layer of the website. Can you help?

**#1 Read Replicas** - Separate the read and write traffic. One machine will perform all writes, and data would be replicated to other nodes which will serve only read requests for application

**#2 Connection Pooling** - Reuse existing connections and reduce the overhead that comes with establishing a new connection to RDBMS for every query

**#3 Partitioning (Also known as sharding)** - Partition the data based on a particular group or range. e.g All records starting with A-P written in server 1, Q-Z in Server 2

## Big Data and A.I.

While BD and AI are two distinct roles, there is a huge amount of skills overlap.

Big Data Engineers focus on data cleaning, manipulation, ETL, and orchestration pipelines

AI or Machine Learning Engineers focus on feature engineering, model building, and visualization

Big Data and AI teams work closely with each other.

## Big Data Ecosystem

Cluster = A set of nodes connected together in a network
Node = A computer server that is part of a network
Commodity Hardware = Hardware which is relatively inexpensive, widely available and components of it are easily interchangeable.
Because commodity hardware is cheap, it's expected that its components will also fail often. Big Data builds on top of the cluster using commodity hardware and that's why having built-in fault tolerance is crucial.

Ingestion Tools (Sqoop, Flume, Kafka, Nifi)

Processing Tools (MapReduce, Pig, Hive, Spark)

Storage Layers (HDFS)

Security (Ranger, Knox)

Governance Tools (Atlas)

Administration Tools (Zookeeper, Airflow, Ambari)

**Open Source tools are part of the Ecosystem, which provides low entrance cost, but does have some important considerations to be aware of**

Can be complex to install and configure

Each product versions on different schedule

Incompatibility issues with updates

**Some 3rd party companies have packaged these tools together seamlessly to provide an easier experience but at a price.**

## Introduction to Amazon EMR

EMR Cluster Creation and Termination
Amazon EMR is a cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data. EMR supports using open source tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink, Apache Hudi, and Presto. Building your own Hadoop clusters can be hard, time-consuming, and costly.

EMR allows you to create on-demand Hadoop clusters. EMR natively integrates with Amazon S3 and provides an abstraction on top of it called EMRFS. It allows you to access S3 with HDFS compatible interface.

Creating a KeyPair

Login to AWS

Go to Services -> Select EC2 (IMG1)

On the left side navigation column select KeyPair and then click on "Create KeyPair" button (IMG2)

Give your Keypair a name. If you are on Mac or Linux use PEM, if you are on Windows using Putty use PPK. (IMG3)

In any enterprise's journey to Big Data, you will face many other problems beyond what you can solve with this set of tools.

Examples of such challenges include the following:

Aligning the leadership teams on design decisions, use cases,

Getting access to raw data

Configuring network, firewall

As an Architect your job is to think both long term and short term. Identify blind spots and proactively solve them before they become a risk to your project!
