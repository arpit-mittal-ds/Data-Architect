What is a Data Lake
Big Data represent large amounts of data. A Data Lake represents where and that data is stored

Machine Learning, Analytics, and data all come together in a Data Lake. Many Silos that form as a natural consequence of organizational and data structure suddenly have a chance to be broken down.

Data Lake is a central place where we can bring together data, Machine Learning, and Analytics
Data can store data of any type, including unstructured, semi-structured, and structured
Can handle scaling of any size

Breaks data silos

To understand data silo - consider this example. Let say a media and telecom company has multiple products. Say they have internet services, table TV services, home security, and monitoring services. Customers can buy each of these products individually or in bulk. Now in reality what happens is that each of these products is actually handled by a totally different team or a department in an organization. Each product uses its own storage and database systems to store the required data. This makes it incredibly hard to analyze the customer from a 360 perspective. You really want to understand customer behavior across all of your product lines. But since each organization manage each product and have their own system of storing data, this creates data silos. Data Lake solves this problem, by Data Lake brings all the crucial enterprise data under one centralized system. This makes it easy for different organizations within a company to collaborate.
Schema on Read

Data Lakes use Schema on Read technique. Meaning you keep writing the data in the data lake maintaining its original raw format. And enforce the schema when you need to read this data back. This is a different approach than Data Warehousing. In data warehousing (just like in relational DBs) you need to specify the schema first. This makes the process of writing different types of data to data lake at scale very hard to achieve as schema generally evolves very quickly.
Enables Analytics Use Cases

The Data Lake democratizes data and is a cost-effective way to store all data of an organization for later processing. Data Analysts within the company can focus on finding meaningful patterns in data with more visibility and easy access to the required data.

Data lakes store data cheaply and can be used before you have an optimized use case.

Why Data Lakes?

Data Lake promotes organizations where

Innovation is enabled
Real-time, integrated-data Analytics is possible
Data silos are broken, which allows new collaboration and interactions
Companies can be ready for the unknown use case
Data, even new data, can be dynamic, easy to incorporate, and quick to access
Self-service access instead of weeks months of work to get what they need
Companies can readily identify new revenue streams, recognize patterns, provide new types of previously unknown(or unattainable) information to make strategic decisions
